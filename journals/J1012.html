                Name: Tanay Sreedharan
                <br>
                Date: 25-Aug-2022
                <br>
                1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.<br>
                You have to add the ones place then carry over any extra numbers. Then you repeat this step for all
                digits.
                <br>
                2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?<br>
                When adding octal numbers you have to carry over when you reach 8 instead of 10 because you only
                have 8 different digits.
                <br>
                3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?
                <br>
                You have to carry over in hexadecimal when you reach a 16. This is because hex has 16 digits instead
                of 10. Also you have to remember to include letter for digits greater than 9.
                <br>
                4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?<br>
                You have to remeber that it only has two different digits so if you get a two you have to carry that
                number over to a new spot. 
                <br>

                What did I learn?<br>
                I learned how to convert numbers between different systems. Some of the number systems include binary,
                hexadecimal, and octal to convert between. This eventually became clearer to me as i continued to practice.
                <br>
                What challenges did I encounter?<br>
                I had challenges trying to convert between binary and decimal. due to the large amount of digits that
                binary has I made many errors when trying to convert between the two. I would find it easier if we had
                videos to help with this.
                <br>
                How could this experience be improved?<br>
                Some videos could help. Much of the math behind these conversions is difficult. It would be
                significantly easier if we had videos to explains this for us.
                <br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>
                I now understand different types of number systems. I also now understand how to convert between these
                various number systems. This will help when dealing with computers as they work in binary and I will be
                able to use these numbers in our own context.
