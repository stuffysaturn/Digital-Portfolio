                Name: Tanay Sreedharan
                <br>
                Date: 16-Aug-2022
                <br>
                1.1:Playing most Video Games and Emailing people
                <br>
                2.1: Its important because many people will have very similar files and they want to be able to name
                what they want it to be named. This makes it importatnt for different users to make files of the same name
                <br>
                3.1: This is because the home directory is the root place where everything takes place.
                <br>
                4.1: This is useful becasue it tells us the location of where we currently are
                <br>
                5.1: It revists the old commands that were typed originially
                <br>
                6.1: It was not this is because the file did not contain any text. The echo command placed text into the
                file
                <br>
                7.1: The ls command just puts what is in this direct folder. The tree command shows what is in all
                folders.
                <br>
                7.2: You have to choose whether you want to see all the files or just the the files in this folderto
                decide which command
                <br>
                8.1: The sleep command specifies how many seconds it should sleep.
                <br>
                8.2: You can test this by counting the seconds until the command finishes
                <br>
                9.1: It is different because it doesn't show its running
                <br>
                9.2: It means that it won't show that it is occuring
                <br>
                9.3: It represents which job was completed
                <br>
                10.1: It shows all the jobs that are there
                <br>
                10.2: It is all the jobs I have entered
                <br>
                What did I learn? I learned about the many commmands in the terminal.
                <br>
                What challenges did I encounter? None
                <br>
                How could this experience be improved? It is already good
                <br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking? it has made it much clearer on the the exact way in which
                the terminal works and how to use its many commands.
