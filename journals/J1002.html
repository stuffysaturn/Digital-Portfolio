                Name: Tanay Sreedharan
                <br>
                Date: 16-Aug-2022
                <br>
                1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model
                <br>
                Playing most Video Games and Emailing people
                <br>
                2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?
                <br>
                Its important because many people will have very similar files and they want to be able to name
                what they want it to be named. This makes it importatnt for different users to make files of the same name
                <br>
                3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?<br>
                This is because the home directory is the root place where everything takes place.
                <br>
                4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?<br>
                This is useful becasue it tells us the location of where we currently are
                <br>
                5.1: What happens each time you press the up arrow?<br> 
                It revists the old commands that were typed originially
                <br>
                What happens if you press the down arrow?<br>
                You got to the command that you typed earlier.
                <br>
                6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?<br>
                It was not this is because the file did not contain any text. The echo command placed text into the
                file
                <br>
                7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?<br>
                The ls command just puts what is in this direct folder. The tree command shows what is in all
                folders.
                <br>
                7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?<br>
                You have to choose whether you want to see all the files or just the the files in this folder to
                decide which command
                <br>
                8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?<br>
                The sleep command specifies how many seconds it should sleep.
                <br>
                8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?<br>
                You can test this by counting the seconds until the command finishes
                <br>
                9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?<br>
                It is different because it doesn't show its running
                <br>
                9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?<br>
                It means that it won't show that it is occuring
                <br>
                9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?<br>
                It represents which job was completed
                <br>
                10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?<br>
                It shows all the jobs that are there
                <br>
                10.2: How do you explain your observations?<br>
                It is all the jobs I have entered
                <br>
                What did I learn? <br>I learned about the many commmands in the terminal.
                <br>
                What challenges did I encounter? <br>None
                <br>
                How could this experience be improved? <br?It is already good
                <br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking? <br>It has made it much clearer on the the exact way in which
                the terminal works and how to use its many commands.
