                Date: 25-Aug-2022
                <br>
                1.1: What is Git communicating to you?<br>
                It shows me the previous logged items
                <br>
                1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?<br>
                Git log shows me the previous logs and git commit adds new files to your repo
                <br>
                1.3: Why do you think this is? <br>
                This is because they both deal with the github
                <br>
                2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?<br>
                One has just been edited while the other file is a completly new file
                <br>
                2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?<br>
                They are displayed in different areas beacuse one is a new file while the other is edited
                <br>
                3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?<br>
                One has just been edited while the other file is a completly new file
                <br>
                3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.<br>
                They are found in different areas
                <br>
                4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?<br>
                It says that there are two files that have been changed
                <br>
                4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?<br>
                It shows the changes that have been made to each of the files and are now green.
                <br>
                5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?<br>
                It says that they have already been comitted so it has not been changed
                <br>
                What did I learn? <br>I learned how to commit files to github and view repositories
                <br>
                What challenges did I encounter?<br>I had challenges getting the github to commit.
                <br>
                How could this experience be improved?<br>It was good
                <br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>It has changed on my way of github knowledge and I now
                understand it mose ways now.
