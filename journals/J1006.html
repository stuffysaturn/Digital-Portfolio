                <br>
                1.1:It shows me the previous logged items
                <br>
                1.2:Git log shows me the previous logs and git commit adds new files to your repo
                <br>
                1.3:This is because they both deal with the github
                <br>
                2.1:One has just been edited while the other file is a completly new file
                <br>
                2.2:They are displayed in different areas beacuse one is a new file while the other is edited
                <br>
                3.1:One has just been edited while the other file is a completly new file
                <br>
                3.2:They are found in different areas
                <br>
                4.1:It says that there are two files that have been changed
                <br>
                4.2:It shows the changes that have been made to each of the files
                <br>
                5.1:It says that they have already been comitted so it has not been changed
                <br>
                What did I learn? I learned how to commit files to github and view repositories
                <br>
                What challenges did I encounter?I had challenges getting the github to commit.
                <br>
                How could this experience be improved?It was good
                <br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?It has changed on my way of github knowledge and I now
                understand it mose ways now.
