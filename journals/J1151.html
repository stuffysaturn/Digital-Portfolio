                <br>
                1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?<br>
                It allows for a large amount of varied outcomes based on singular boolean statements which is very
                useful.<br>
                1.2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the
                Boolean test evaluates to true?<br>
                This is because when our outcome evaluates to true we get a certain outocme, but when we recieve a
                different pathway it changes.<br>
                2.1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whther the jump will be executed or
                not?<br>
                This is because we want to only run the consequent pathway when the value is true and only want to run
                the alternate pathway if the boolean pathway passed in is false.<br>
                2.2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?<br>
                This is so that if we want to run the alternate function and we need to be able to skip over to it after
                we have run the consequent.<br>
                2.3: Why is there no need for corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?<br>
                This is because when running the items it works in a sequentional order meaning that ofter the
                alternative runs when needed afterwards anyway without a command.<br>
                What did I learn?<br>
                I learned about flowchart and how to construct them and how using conditionals in assembly language is
                very similar to that<br>

                What challenges did I encounter?<br>

                Understanding some of the syntax for the assembly was difficult for me<br>
                How could this experience be improved?<br>
                Going into more depth about the assembly language could be very helpful to understanding it more<br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>
                It can help me plan out a logical pathway when creating and writing code, and will probably be very
                useful when trying to construct my ISP for this class.<br>
