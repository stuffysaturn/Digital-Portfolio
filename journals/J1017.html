                1.1 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?
                <br>
                It has the same standard output as an AND gate would have.<br>
                1.2 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?
                <br>
                It has the same standard output as a OR gate would have.<br>
                2.1 What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder
                as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?
                <br>
                The outputs for both of the tables are exactly the same and resemble each other.<br>
                2.2 Why is this true?
                <br>
                This is because the first column is not being used during these four outputs so it will produce the same
                output as the half-adder.<br>
                3.1 Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?
                <br>
                This is because in the first spot we only have two inputs so it will only need a half-adder.<br>
                3.2 Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from
                S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?
                <br>
                No, because these values wait on the processes occurng to the right. It is a chain reaction so it will
                take time for the chain to reach the end to get the S value.<br>
                3.3 Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two
                numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we
                infer? What is this state commonly called?
                <br>
                It can be inferred that all of our inputs were true resulting in a very large number that the calculator
                could not handle.<br>
                What did I learn?<br>
                I learned about the various uses of hald-adders and full-adders in computers and how they function.<br>
                What challenges did I encounter?<br>

                At first it was very difficult to understand the many truth tables presented. It was an overwhelming
                amount of information.<br>
                How could this experience be improved?<br>

                Including videos or an in class lecture would be useful to help understanding this complex topic.<br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>

                I now understand the various ways computers function and why it can take a long time to proces a simple
                math equation.
