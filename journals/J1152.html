                1.1: Why is the test executed prior to the loop?<br>
                This is because when we use loops they follow a sequential order. This means that it first has to check
                the loop test statement and then goes to the consequent or alternative.<br>
                1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the
                differences?<br>
                In a conditional statement if is and if statements to determine which statements will run. This will
                then run this statement once while a loop will run this multiple times.<br>
                1.3: What is the purpose of the jump instruction after the consequent?<br>
                It jumps back to run the conditional test again to see if the loop should continue or not.<br>
                What did I learn?<br>
                I learned how to use loops and what many of them are used for in programming.<br>

                What challenges did I encounter?<br>
                The syntax for programming this was different compared to many other languages.<br>

                How could this experience be improved?<br>
                Spending more time in class teaching about loops.<br>
                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>
                I know understand the various loops used when creating swift code<br>
