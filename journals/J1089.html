                1.1: Why do you think Hello World! is the first program taught to students?<br>
                This is because it is a simple print statement that can easoly be printed by beginner programmers.<br>
                1.2: How might the Hello World program be different is this were written in a different programming
                language?<br>
                The way to write print statements in various languages differs making the syntax in what you would write
                differ among languages.<br>
                What did I learn?<br>
                I learned and now understand the basics of swift, and how to do if and else statements along with the
                ability to use print statements to view items in the console.<br>

                What challenges did I encounter?<br>

                Without a teacher this lesson was a bit challengning to understand the many swift commands, but I was
                able to fiure out the syntax of all of them.<br>
                How could this experience be improved?<br>
                This lesson was veyr short so increasing the quantity and or combining it with another lesson might be
                helpful.<br>

                How has what I learned affected my thinking?<br>
                I now understand the basics of swift and how started on my journey on learning the intracies of the this
                complicated language.<br>
